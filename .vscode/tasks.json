          // Type: The beginsPattern is a regex pattern used to match specific lines of output from the task.
          // Matching: It matches any part of the output line that fits the pattern. It doesn't need to match the entire line.
          // Case Sensitivity: By default, regex patterns are case-sensitive. If you need a case-insensitive match, you can use the i flag.
          //                    "beginsPattern": "(?i)http://localhost:\\d+"   => (?i) makes it case insensitive!  ==> DOES NOT WORK!!
          //                    "beginsPattern":"/vite.*ready/i"              => ALSO DOES NOT WORK
          //   => no case insensivity possible
